Hello, and thank you for reading this Readme file 


The file directories are set up as follows

src -- where the source files go, class implementations and exercises are found here. 
			main.cpp 
			BinaryNode.cpp 
			BinaryNodeTree.cpp 
			BinarySearchTree.cpp


headers -- headers for the abstractions, class declarations are here.
			BinaryNode.h
			BinaryNodeTree.h 
			BinarySearchTree.h
            BinaryTreeInterface.h

build -- object files, executables, makefile and shells.
    All building shall be done from this file 
    building shall be done with the Linux make system

make -- 
    to make simply type  " make " 
    to clean type        " make clean"

    make clean will remove all objects and executables in the build directory.
    
Documenation -- contains the report file, and text output files
			ReportFile.docx -- contains the screenshots and descriptions of the program being run and shows the output
			output.txt -- was meant to show the output of all selections but ran out of time, commented out a test statement, so it will print the traversals into the file, it doesn't have clean spacing and may
                            be hard to read.
